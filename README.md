  I am an Electronics and Communication Pre-Final Year Undergrad with a keep interest in Robotics and Web Development. I have worked on various full stack web products and have made some IoT Based Automation systems. I am mad about cosmology, so if you are one of them, I will buy you a Coffee. Else if you loved my work, you may buy me one!<br/>
